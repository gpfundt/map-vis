# map-vis

In this project I plot earthquakes from the United States Geological Survey on a map. The earthquakes from the dataset are plotted based on their longitude and latitude and the circle markers are reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. The map also has popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
